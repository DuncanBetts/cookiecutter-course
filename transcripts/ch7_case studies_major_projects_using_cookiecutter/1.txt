00:01 By now you're quite capable with Cookiecutter,
00:04 you know all the advance uses as a user,
00:07 you know how to create your own including things like hooks
00:11 and conditional statements inside the cookiecutter.json,
00:14 as well as how to use the API to actually wrap up
00:17 the functionality of Cookiecutter with a nicer shell.
00:20 So I think it's a good time to take a moment and just look around the industry
00:25 and see how other people, other projects are using Cookiecutter.
00:29 Now, I grabbed three projects that I'm familiar with
00:32 but there are many more as you saw when we did a search on GitHub,
00:36 there was quite a few options out there.
00:39 So feel free to do your own exploration
00:41 I'm going to take you on a tour of three particular projects
00:44 first one we are going to look at is Beeware,
00:46 these guys are doing really interesting cross-platform
00:50 native type things with Python and Cookiecutter plays a central role in this
00:53 so I think this is going to be an interesting use case here;
00:57 OpenStack, OpenStack is an open source largely Python based
01:02 version of more or less AWS, right,
01:05 you can take and add VM capabilities, you can add storage capabilities,
01:10 database capabilities, all sorts of stuff like this and it's quite a large project
01:14 so working with it can be quite challenging, and so you'll see
01:18 how they're using Cookiecutter on certain parts of OpenStack.
01:21 Finally, we'll look at the Pyramid web framework,
01:25 this is a project that I've been involved with
01:27 on the Cookiecutter side as well as the web app
01:30 and you'll get a look inside how these guys are moving to Cookiecutter.
