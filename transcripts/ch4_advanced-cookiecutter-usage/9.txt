00:01 Now sometimes when you're working, 
00:03 you want to replay exactly what you just entered, 
00:07 this is common if you're doing sort of template generation, 
00:11 like if you're building a template for your own project, 
00:13 or maybe even from continuous integration, so let's go over here 
00:16 and just look really quick at this, notice that it's the bottle, 
00:20 the cookiecutter for creating bottle, blah, blah, blah, right, 
00:23 so this was passed to this template, right, the name of here and all sorts of stuff, 
00:29 my name and so on, so let's erase this, and do one more time, 
00:32 we're going to create it just as before, but instead of doing any of this stuff,
00:37 we're going to say --replay hit enter, and boom, done, 
00:43 if we go back over here, we now have the Bottle, if we look at this, 
00:49 we can see "The Bottle" like that 
00:54 and we have the_bottle typed like this. 
00:56 Those are exactly the values that we passed in, so what you can do 
00:59 is that you can run a template and it may have some interesting questions 
01:03 it was going to ask you, and we can just say --replay 
01:06 and it's going to store that somewhere. 
01:09 The question is where is this stored, well, if we look here, 
01:14 we now have two cookiecutters we have a ~/.cookiecutter and a ~/.cookiecutter_replay,
01:19 we look in there, there is a cookiecutter-bottle.json, 
01:23 alright, so let's just look and see what's in there. 
01:26 And notice, we have cookiecutter full_name is Michael Kennedy, 
01:30 those three came from our defaults, 
01:33 I mean, we entered them into the system, but those came from the defaults. 
01:37 This one and that one we passed on the command line 
01:41 and this one was just the default out of the template 
01:44 and so it's stored with the final results set of all the values passed to the template 
01:48 before it ran it, in this file, right, so you can on a per template type bases
01:54 always do cookiecutter cookiecutter-the-thing --replay 
01:58 and it's going to do that same this, so for example,
02:01 on some sort of continuous integration thing,
02:04 you could run this once and then it will store this value 
02:06 or technically you could little adjust create this file, 
02:10 and put it in the right place and then those values will be used 
02:12 regardless of what gets put in the template.
02:15 This is also super useful if you're developing your own template, 
02:18 you want to type in something under certain circumstances, 
02:21 see what is generated, oh it didn't come out right, go make it edit, 
02:24 rerun it --replay make an edit, rerun it --replay you'll get the hang of it.
