00:01 Let me show you how you can add occasional extra defaults, 
00:05 so this default file this is a default forever, 
00:08 you will always have all of those defaults, 
00:10 now, it might be that you want to run this, from the command line 
00:14 and for some reason, you want to set the app name to something else. 
00:17 So let's try this, if we go over here and just say app_name=
00:23 and we just use key=value, and we say app_name=the_bottle 
00:27 and let's also say project_name="The Bottle" like this, 
00:31 now if we run it, we'll see that we get the defaults from our default file, 
00:35 Michael Kennedy, email, GitHub and now, project_name default is "The Bottle", 
00:40 instead of "My Bottle App", app name is the_bottle, right, 
00:43 so if you're going to try to automate this stuff, this is really nice 
00:47 and maybe even you want to give it a no inputs at this point. 
00:50 Alright, so here we could do this, and we could of course say --no-input 
00:55 and even a -f
01:00 And boom, there it goes, so now we have "The Bottle", 
01:04 and we actually created it twice, first when I hit enter a bunch of times, 
01:07 the second one when I just ran that one command line.
