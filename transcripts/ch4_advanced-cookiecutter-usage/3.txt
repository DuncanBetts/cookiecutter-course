00:01 Alright, let's quickly play with verbose mode. 
00:05 We've seen that we're able to run cookiecutter with no inputs,
00:08 let's try it in verbose mode, it's going to ask some questions, 
00:11 tell me all sorts of stuff like here is some default values we're using, 
00:15 we generated this context and this is what we're going to use 
00:18 to start asking these questions, 
00:21 okay, so I'll just go and give it some values,
00:24 let's let it suppose that that's my username, and this is fine, 
00:28 we'll take this as well, and then it does a whole bunch of work, 
00:33 let's make this bigger, so it's great, we're searching okay it appears to be 
00:38 that this file is what we're going to use for the project, 
00:41 we're going to generate the project from that, we're rendering the directory 
00:45 and then we're making sure that it doesn't exist, 
00:48 first we create the directory then we make sure it does exists, right, 
00:51 okay there it goes, and it found no hooks, if there were hooks, 
00:54 it would say we're running the pre generation script, the post generation script, 
00:57 that's what hooks are about, so it's processing all these files that are here, 
01:00 it's transformed requirements to see if anything is there, 
01:04 change the readme and it checks to see what's binary 
01:06 then it wrote the contents of that, which is cool, 
01:09 remember it uses like the summary or whatever of the project that goes there, 
01:13 you could just go through and see all the steps that it's going, 
01:16 as it's processing these files and finally there is no post hooks either, 
01:20 so it didn't run that and we're done. 
01:22 Alright, so this verbose mode is really helpful if you need it, 
01:25 especially when you're creating your own templates.
