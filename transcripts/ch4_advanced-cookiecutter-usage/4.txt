00:02 We've seen that Cookiecutter templates have default values for us, 
00:05 so if I come over here and I type cookiecutter cookiecutter-model
00:09 and I run this, it will provide a default, 
00:12 like a default name and a default email and so on,
00:15 and if I don't like mybottleapp as the name, I have to type that in.
00:18 If that's not my GitHub username, I have to type that in. 
00:21 Wouldn't it be great if we could somehow configure the system
00:24 so like those defaults were ours if we had entered them- 
00:27 of course you can, and I'll show you how to do it.
