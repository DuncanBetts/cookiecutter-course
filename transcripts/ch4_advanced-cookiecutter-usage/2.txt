00:02 I told you that the no inputs feature might be really nice 
00:06 for continuous integration and this is not a CI build machine or anything, 
00:10 but let's go and have a look anyway. 
00:12 So we can run cookiecutter cookiecutter-bottle 
00:15 and it was going to ask us some questions, 
00:18 now let's just take the all of the defaults for now, 
00:21 so if I say yes this is my name, this is my email address, 
00:24 this is my GitHub user, whatever, 
00:27 boom, and then it's going to generate this mybottlea. 
00:30 Alright, so if we go and look in here, we'll see that things like,
00:34 we'll see it named it mybottle like we had said, 
00:37 if we look at the read me you can see it's just taken the defaults everywhere, 
00:41 okay, so that's all going good, let's go back out for a second here, 
00:44 and erase this so we have nothing in this folder anymore. 
00:48 So now we can run this again, but this time, without it asking any questions, 
00:51 just say take all the defaults which is what we did anyway 
00:54 but I had to hit enter a bunch of times. 
00:59 So say --no-input and we hit enter, and bam, what happens, 
01:06 well it generates exactly the same thing, 
01:09 so if you're going to make executing a cookiecutter template 
01:12 as part of something like continuous integration build 
01:15 or if for whatever reason you want to run it 
01:18 without it asking the user questions then you got this. 
01:20 You'll see that we can actually pass additional information
01:22 to overwrite some of those values, when we run this 
01:25 when we get to consuming the cookiecutter API 
01:27 you will see that you can pass no input 
01:29 but then overwrite it with stuff that maybe your program asks for, 
01:32 things like that, so it's pretty cool, but this is a good start, 
01:35 I guess the most common use case I see here 
01:38 really is for continuous integration or some form of testing.
