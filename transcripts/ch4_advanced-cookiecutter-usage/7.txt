00:01 Let me show you something that I ran into that seems really touchy, 
00:05 with these default value files, we come over here 
00:08 and we can run our cookiecutter cookiecutter-bottle and it gives us our values, 
00:11 everything looked great, and that looked super easy, right. 
00:14 Well, let's go and make the most minor change, 
00:17 and notice that there is a line 5 that is empty here, 
00:20 if you are unfortunate enough to not have hit enter and then backed up one time, 
00:24 you're going to run into something weird, 
00:27 so let's leave it like this, right, all I did was remove that last blank line, 
00:30 I changed nothing else about it, and now let's try this again, 
00:33 if I hit enter, bam, unable to parse the YAML file, error, 
00:37 none of the patterns match for GitHub usernames, like oh what is this. 
00:41 So apparently, I am not sure where this touchiness lies, 
00:45 is this Cookiecutter's built-in YAML parser, is this actually the YAML specification, 
00:49 I don't know, but let me just tell you, you really need a newline there, 
00:54 so now if I do it again, everything works like a charm. 
00:58 Okay, so super important, you have a blank line there.
