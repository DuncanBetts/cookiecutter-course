00:01 Now you've seen that we could use this command cookiecutter 
00:05 and the full path to the GitHub repo to clone our template and run it, 
00:11 but once we've done this, on our machine, in this user profile, 
00:15 we can use a much simpler version, we could just say cookiecutter 
00:19 and give it the short name, cookiecutter-bottle
00:22 And we hit enter, again, it runs, 
00:24 however, if I try other ones like cookiecutter-data-science 
00:27 it says I have no idea what this is, and look where it is looking. 
00:32 So in your user profile, my username is screencaster for this recording, 
00:37 so if I go here and look, you can see that this is the location 
00:42 where that cloning gets done, so when we make this command, 
00:45 to the git repo, it actually clones it and stores in our profile under .cookiecutters 
00:50 and if we come here and say cd cookiecutter-bottle 
00:54 you can see that this should look exactly like hat git repo that we saw earlier, 
00:58 do you know why- because it is that git repo we saw earlier, 
01:02 it's the same thing, right, it just clones it, 
01:04 in fact, if I run the original command again, it says you've already cloned it here, 
01:08 do you want to reclone it? 
01:11 So, basically, you can install these things, very easily.
01:14 you just run the git version or the remote version,
01:17 and then once you have that you can run the simpler version, like this. 
01:22 So what would be cool is if there was some kind of thing 
01:26 like we could say list those, 
01:29 so if I could say cookiecutter -i for installed or something, but there is no -i 
01:33 Right, so maybe someday that will change, 
01:36 maybe even I will add that feature, I don't know, 
01:38 but for now, you can tell what you have installed, just by doing this. 
01:41 List the Cookiecutter directory in your home profile, 
01:45 and on Windows, you don't use the tilde of course, 
01:48 but this is just in your home directory in Windows as well, 
01:50 it's just .cookiecutters on both platforms.
