00:02 You've seen there is some really cool projects, or templates 
00:06 that we can grab from that pantry and go and create things. 
00:09 Let's look in a particular one, 
00:11 here we've got one that will create a Bottle web application.
00:14 So Bottle is what you might call a microframework, 
00:17 in the Python web framework space, so we can use this template 
00:21 to create one along with the dependencies, and a little bit of starter code for us. 
00:24 Let's start over here in the pantry, and you can see right here, 
00:27 I've already clicked on it, cookiecutter-bottle 
00:30 for creating reusable Bottle projects quickly. 
00:33 Alright, so we can go over here and notice, this is just a public git repo, 
00:36 and the way you can there is some Cookiecutter stuff going on 
00:39 is this {{cookiecutter.stuff}} we'll see what that means later, 
00:44 but if you look inside here, basically these are the files 
00:47 that are going to be used when you run the template. 
00:50 Like I said, when we get to another section about creating our own templates,
00:53 we'll go way into detail there, but notice, I can just take the url, 
00:56 not the clone url or the get url, just the url to the repo itself. 
00:59 And I can come over here and I can install that using Cookiecutter, 
01:04 so I am in our shared source so whatever I do here you will be able 
01:09 to get so I am going to start by saying Cookiecutter that, 
01:13 I am just going to give it the https url to the git repo here. 
01:18 Now I could also give it a path to a directory if I had 
01:20 for some reason downloaded and cloned this, but I don't need to, 
01:23 Cookiecutter will do that for us, okay, so we run it, 
01:27 it takes just a moment to quietly clone it in the background, 
01:30 it asks us what our name is, I'll go and put my name, 
01:33 it asks us what our email is, I'll do that as well, 
01:37 my GitHub, no that's not me, that is me, 
01:41 and what I want to call this, Super bottle web, something like that, 
01:45 and I'll just call it super_bottle, like that, this needs to be 
01:48 some kind of folder that Python could use as a web app name, 
01:53 so probably no spaces, things like that and you will see later 
01:57 that you can actually validate it, I don't know if this template does,
02:00 we hit enter and if I don't want to put a description 
02:03 and I am willing to take whatever they put in here, if I just hit enter, 
02:06 any of these things in the brackets for example mybottleapp 
02:09 or that version of it or this, if I just hit enter that is going to be 
02:11 the description that is used, so everything in a bracket is just a default, 
02:15 we'll see how you can set up global defaults for yourself as well later 
02:18 but the template is giving you a default first,
02:21 right, we hit enter and done. 
02:24 So, let's see what we got, well, 
02:26 we've got a super_bottle folder here, let's open it up and have a look. 
02:29 So if we go in here, notice we've got the manage.py we've got the README,
02:33 let's go over here and cd into the super_bottle, 
02:36 and just look at the README here, so here you can say 
02:42 it's a cookiecutter template for creating this 
02:45 and this is the default that we saw right here, 
02:48 see my Super bottle web, and so on, it shows me how to get started, 
02:50 so python manage.py runserver 
02:53 Okay, that's cool, now actually I am going to need to install these requirements here 
02:59 I don't have Bottle or Click or Jinja2, potentially installed, 
03:03 now you don't need to know any Python to use Cookiecutter, 
03:05 but just to show you I can take this thing and run it for that, 
03:08 because it's a Python web app, we got to do a really quick thing, 
03:10 so let me just briefly create a virtual environment 
03:13 so this thing doesn't actually affect my machine here, 
03:16 so what I am going to do is I am going to say python3 -m venv [path]
03:20 and this can be a clean place 
03:22 where we just install things for the rest of this class here,
03:25 so that was cool, that worked, and then I got to activate it, 
03:28 okay, notice that my prompt has changed, okay, great, 
03:32 so let's go ahead and install the requirements, 
03:36 we'll say pip install -r requirements
03:39 so it's going to download all the packages that this thing 
03:43 that was just created needs to run, and now, we can just say 
03:46 python manage.py runserver and look at that, it's up and running, 
03:50 let's go see what we got here. 
03:53 Congratulations, our app worked, 
03:55 okay, great, so now go write your web app, basically,
03:57 but it's setup that structure, the requirements, 
03:59 all that so we could get started more quickly. 
04:03 This is pretty cool, right, well, there is not a lot going on here, 
04:05 because hey, this is Bottle, it's a micro framework, 
04:08 if we had done this with Pyramid, you would have seen actually 
04:11 a lot more stuff happen and we'll do that later.
