00:01 In order to share your Cookiecutter template 
00:03 you're going to need somewhere where you can put it online 
00:06 and people can access it.
00:09 It could be like a zip file in Dropbox they could download,
00:12 but probably the best place to put it would be 
00:14 somewhere to like GitHub, because remember,
00:16 you can take the GitHub URL directly and to just say cookiecutter that,
00:19 and so this is super easy for people to consume;
00:22 so if I want to share my template cookiecutter-pyramid-talk-python-starter 
00:25 obviously in needs to be on GitHub, and here it is.
00:28 Step number one is to get your thing publicly accessible,
00:33 next we're going to want to get it into this Cookiecutter documentation page,
00:38 in particular we want to get it right here, so the way we're going to do this 
00:42 is it says, it kind of assumes you know a lot about gitflow and whatnot
00:46 but it says make your own template and then submit a pull request 
00:49 adding yours to the list, so what does that mean?
00:52 Well if we go to the top of this page, and we say edit on GitHub, 
00:55 this is the page they are talking about.
00:58 We can come over here and we can fork this, 
01:01 so the way it works is if we want to create pull request 
01:04 we have to fork the repository, check it out ourselves, 
01:06 make a change to our own copy, push that back and then use GitHub to do a fork. 
01:10 So that's what we're going to do.
01:13 So, step number one, fork, let's go here so we're forking it, 
01:17 it takes just a few seconds, it's true, excellent, you can see up here,
01:20 mikeyckennedy/cookicutter and you can see 
01:23 it's forked from audreyr/cookiecutter project. 
01:27 So now we need to clone this somewhere, so I am going to come over here
01:30 and let's take a step back, and what I am going to do is 
01:34 I am just going to get cloned it right here so you have exactly what I made, 
01:37 what changes I made here, so git clone that, 
01:40 that was easy, right, so then, we'll go in cookiecutter and look around. 
01:46 So if we go down here, we look at README.rst and let's just open this,
01:52 let's open this with Atom is fine, alright, there is a bunch of stuff here, 
01:57 if we go and we look down, we say make your own and submit a pull request, 
02:01 okay, great, so what is this section here, we have Python and your job is
02:07 to either create a section or figure out what section is the right one for your project, 
02:11 so let's scroll down here, we have Python-Django, that's not us, Python-Pyramid, 
02:17 aha now we're getting somewhere, so what we want to do is 
02:20 we want to create one of these here. 
02:23 So let's just duplicate this line, and let's remember what I called it,
02:27 name matters here, right, so I called it this, cookiecutter-pyramid-talk-python-starter 
02:34 and that's going to go there, let's also make the copy of this, 
02:37 you need to give it the URL here so let's copy that, 
02:40 then we need to give it a description here, 
02:44 so this seems like a decent description, close enough. 
02:48 Alright, so if we save this, it's possible that I've messed up something,
02:52 but that I think I got it right, we went to Python-Pyramid, 
02:55 we created the cookiecutter-pyramid-talk-python-starter, 
02:58 we've given it the description and we've given it the link here. 
03:01 Excellent, so we've forked the repository, first we put our stuff up on GitHub, 
03:06 we forked the repository, we checked it out, we cloned it, 
03:09 and we've now made the change to the README.rst; 
03:13 next up, we're going to have to submit a pull request.
