00:02 Now, you've been able to create your own template 
00:05 you probably want to share it with the world.
00:06 I suppose there's two different paths you might be on 
00:10 with this template itself 
00:12 one remember what I called the working farther with integrated systems 
00:16 that might happen inside of your company and you probably wouldn't want to do that 
00:20 but if you are working on anything open source or out in the public
00:24 you will very much likely want to have your Cookiecutter listed 
00:26 on the Cookiecutter home page, of course you'll have it in your documentation
00:29 and you'll have it on your website and so on, 
00:32 but you go ahead and put it to here so everybody can find it.
00:35 Right, so what we're going to talk about is how we take a template that we create 
00:39 and get it listed here, as well as just generally make it available to the world.
