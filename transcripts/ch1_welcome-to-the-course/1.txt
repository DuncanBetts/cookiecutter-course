00:01 Hello and welcome to "Using and Mastering Cookiecutter".
00:06 I'm really excited that you are taking this course 
00:09 and that you are interested into looking into Cookiecutter. 
00:12 It's a fantastic tool and it's really powerful, 
00:15 I think you are going to learn and appreciate a lot of that power, in this course. 
00:20 Let's begin by answering the question what is Cookiecutter? 
00:23 Well, we can create a template, a set of files for any given project, 
00:27 this could be a Python application, this could be an Apple application, 
00:31 this could even just be some scientific research project template 
00:35 that doesn't have any code at all, we're going to create this template 
00:39 and we're going to feed it to the Cookiecutter engine.
00:42 Now, this could be Python, it could be C++, it could be C#, 
00:48 the language of the template is irrelevant, it's about managing files 
00:51 and resources and creating project structure from some source template
00:56 and asking the user a certain number of questions, 
00:59 so things like what is your project called, 
01:02 are you going to deploy this to the cloud, 
01:05 what ORM are you going to use and so on. 
01:07 So we are going to take the template and feed this information into Cookiecutter 
01:10 and out pops a brand new shiny, ready to start project. 
01:13 So that is what Cookiecutter is. 
01:16 It takes templates called Cookiecutters, 
01:19 and it generates via asking the users a couple of questions, 
01:22 project templates for any type of app that you want to get started with. 
01:26 Cookiecutter was created by Audrey Roy Greenfeld, back in 2013, 
01:32 you may know Audrey from the Two Scoops of Django, 
01:35 she and her husband Danny wrote this book and it's very well known Django book, 
01:39 you can read Danny's announcement of the Cookiecutter project here at this url, 
01:44 when they first launched it, it will give you a little background information 
01:48 on what Cookiecutter is and why they created it. 
01:51 So, when and how do you use Cookiecutter? 
01:53 I think there is two cases, on one hand you might just be 
01:56 a user who wants to just consume Cookiecutter templates,
02:00 I want to create a new Django project that is set up 
02:02 just so based on a Cookiecutter template, 
02:05 I want to create a new Pyramid web app based on a Cookiecutter template.
02:09 So, for these types of users, there is certain benefits, 
02:13 first of all, you can easily create very complex and intricate projects, 
02:17 the Cookiecutter can be set up to create the project however it needs to be done, 
02:21 and all you have to do is answer a few basic questions, 
02:24 and instead of worrying about what files you have to create, 
02:27 how they are relatively located to each other, things like that, the formats, 
02:30 you just answer a few questions and boom, you have some new app ready to roll. 
02:34 It makes the process of creating projects very repeatable, and that is nice. 
02:39 It also is faster onboarding for new developers, 
02:42 so instead of teaching developers all the things you need to know 
02:45 about the layout and structure of a project, you can just say run this command, 
02:49 Cookiecutter (space) my template name, and boom, they are ready to go.
02:53 On the other hand, you might want to create Cookiecutter template, 
02:57 maybe you work at a company and you want to create 
03:00 a Cookiecutter template for your team or your organization, 
03:02 or you might run an open source project where you want to create 
03:05 a template for users of that open source project. 
03:08 So here you can possibly increase adoption of your project, 
03:11 maybe it was something that was kind of hard to get started with, 
03:14 and now because you have a simple template to do so, 
03:17 it's easy, you can reduce support costs or support effort right, 
03:22 you won't have to answer those, well, how do I get started, 
03:24 how do I do this thing, or how do I set up that to get this thing to run, 
03:28 your Cookiecutter template will get them beyond the initial setup steps 
03:31 so you basically can skip a bunch of those questions and challenges. 
03:35 You can help users fall into the pit of success, 
03:39 by that I mean you can setup your project, so that everything is set up 
03:43 in the best possible way before they even start to touch it, 
03:46 and give them the guidance to get going, 
03:48 not just creating the file structure and so on, 
03:50 but actually asking them the right questions. 
03:53 And as you will see in the programmatic part, 
03:56 you can even wrap this up in a little application, 
03:58 that makes this process of creation even nicer. 
04:01 And, you could gain more exposure for your project, 
04:03 if it's an open source project, you could get that project listed 
04:06 in the Cookiecutter documentation saying here is a way to create this cool project, 
04:10 people might look at that and go oh, I didn't know that existed, 
04:13 let me check that out, and of course, it will be easy for them to do so, 
04:16 because they just have to run your template. 
04:18 Finally, if you work inside a company, this can provide
04:21 a lot of consistency across your organization. 
04:24 If the way all new projects that your company created is 
04:27 by running a certain Cookiecutter template for your technology, 
04:30 then you can be sure that there is a minimum level of consistency
04:34 across all those projects and if you have a lot of projects, 
04:37 a lot of developers all working in parallel, this can be super valuable 
04:40 if you invest into these templates. 
04:43 So, this is just some of the use cases 
04:46 and some of the reasons that you might use Cookiecutter. 
04:48 We'll talk about a whole bunch more as you go through this course.
