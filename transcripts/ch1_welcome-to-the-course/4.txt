00:01 Everything you see me create during this course 
00:04 will be available to you in this github repository 
00:07 github.com/mikeckennedy/cookiecutter-course
00:11 I think programming is best learned through examples, through trying it yourself, 
00:16 so I want to make sure everything that I do in this course, 
00:19 is saved and preserved for you. 
00:21 Be sure right now to go visit that url, star and fork that repository. 
00:26 At least star it and download it if you don't want to fork it, 
00:30 but make sure you save this, because this is your reference material 
00:33 for the things that we create during this course.
