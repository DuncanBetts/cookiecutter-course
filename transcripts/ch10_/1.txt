 
00:01 Congratulations, you've made it to the end of this course,
00:05 and not only did you make it through the course 
00:08 you now have a new magic power- it's called cookiecutter.
00:11 So the question is what are you going to build now?
00:15  I think you should take this moment, pause this video 
00:18 and write down three things you think could be made better with cookiecutter
00:22 and then make a plan to create at least one of those over the next month
00:27 if we all did that, think how many cool things we could create 
00:30 with cookiecutter in just a really short time.
00:34 So congratulations, I hope you feel as you've gained 
00:36 a lot of knowledge about cookiecutter
00:38 that you can now use this new tool to do amazing things 
00:41 both with your own project, as well as other cookiecutter templates 
00:44 that people have already created and published to the pantry full of cookies.
00:49 Let's do a quick lightning review. So we started out in this course 
00:52 by discussing what is cookiecutter and when to use it 
00:56 and you saw that cookiecutter is a project template creation framework 
01:00 we can take these templates, we can run them 
01:03 we can create any sort of project it doesn't have to be Python 
01:06 even though the implementation is Python.
01:08 We saw that we can create Atari games C++ applications 
01:11 JavaScript apps all sorts of stuff;
01:14 we talked about some of the advanced features, running cookiecutter
01:17 with no inputs, great for continuous integration and unit tests,  
01:20 things like that; running it with the replay option so that it just reruns 
01:25 whatever we configure it to run, again this is good
01:29 for when you're building your own temple 
01:31 it's good when you're doing continuous integration 
01:33 and you don't want to take the default 
01:35 we also saw that it can be annoying to type in answer 
01:37 questions like what's your name, what's your e mail 
01:39 what's your gituhub account name and things like that continuously 
01:41 so we can create a global default file that solves that once and for all.
01:45 We talked about creating templates, we'd start with the cookiecutter.json file 
01:50 that has the prompts as well as things like extensions, 
01:54 files that we should not transform, copy without render things like that 
01:57 we talked about the folder structure naming our folder things like 
02:01 {{cookiecutter.project_name}} something like this 
02:05 we saw that we can create dependent properties
02:07 that the cookiecutter.json is not just a static thing 
02:10 but it kind of comes to life as it evaluates top to bottom 
02:13 so we can put Jinja expressions in here 
02:15 and do a lot of cool things there for the most advanced features 
02:18 we would use hooks, we have a pre generation hook 
02:21 and a post generation hook
02:24  and we also have a choice variable
02:27 if you've got a small restricted set of things 
02:29 like the template engine you want to use for a web framework 
02:31 a choice variable would be great.
02:34 We saw that we can take this concept of creating templates in a program 
02:38 and make it even better, recall we made our game maker application 
02:43 and it can make hi-lo, it can make pong, and it can make hangman 
02:46 and instead of just having the general prompts and inputs that cookiecutter gives
02:51 we actually wrote a program that would take in that information 
02:54 verify it if it was wrong it asked the question again 
02:57 and get everything ready to go and then it would create the game 
03:01 using the underlying cookiecutter template programmatically 
03:05 so we would call cookiecutter.main.cookiecutter one as a package 
03:10 one as a sub package, the final part is the method we would call that 
03:12 and of course we want to leverage the default values 
03:15 so we could work with the config sub module and pull in the default values 
03:19 for whoever joining this minimize a number of questions 
03:22 or at least make it nicer for them and we created our little app 
03:25 the game maker, and it presented itself 
03:27 more nicely as sort of a project creation thing
03:30 I didn't have to know anything about projection for the most part 
03:33 because it just delegated all that information 
03:36 and that functionality to cookiecutter;
03:39 we went through a few case studies 
03:41 we talked about Beeware, OpenStack and Pyramid 
03:43 and how all three of these projects are making heavy use of cookiecutter 
03:46 and how there's some really interesting stuff happening there;
03:49 we shared our template, in fact,
03:51 I can tell you that the time of this recording now my template 
03:55 that I used as an example in this section 
03:58 is now officially part of the pantry full of cookies 
04:01 on the cookiecutter site, so that process
04:03 I took you through that work for me at least, that was great.
04:06 And finally we talked about modifying cookiecutter
04:09 there was a feature that I- or behavior let's say, not a feature, behavior 
04:13 I didn't like and I've talked about it throughout the course
04:15 that the yaml file, the parsing of is too strict and having a new line at the end 
04:20 is really frustrating we went through and we saw how we could fix that 
04:23 in fact I did a little bit of back and forth with those guys 
04:26 and now that is also accepted and should be officially part of cookiecutter 
04:31 so that shouldn't be a problem anymore, you can use that technique 
04:33 to modify cookiecutter for whatever your needs are.
04:36 Look at that, this is a ton of stuff that you've learned 
04:39 and now you should be really empowered to do cool stuff with cookiecutter.
04:43 But, before you go don't forget to take the code with you 
04:45 visit github.com/mikeyckennedy-cookiecutter-course,
04:49 and star this and fork this so that you have everything 
04:53 that we've done, everything we've created throughout the course  
04:57 with you forever.
04:59 I've done a small amount of reorganization 
05:01 because I noticed as I was doing things live it got a little messy sometimes 
05:05 I had multiple projects generated next to the temple at itself 
05:08 and so it might not look identical but it should be very very similar 
05:11 and self explanatory to what you saw us to together on the screen.
05:16 Thanks so much for taking this course I'll see you online! Bye.
