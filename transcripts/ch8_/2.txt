00:01 Of course the first step with sharing your template is having a template,
00:04 so let me show you the template that I have created 
00:06 crated both for some of my other courses or just for the community 
00:09 and sort of spurred on to do it at this moment, for this particular course. 
00:14 So if we look over in my cookiecutters, there is a thing 
00:17 I'm calling cookiecutter pyramid talk python starter 
00:20 so Pyramid is a web framework, and they use cookiecutter by default
00:24 they have three or four different starter templates,
00:26 and they all pretty basic, and so you start very close to the beginning of a project 
00:31 it doesn't have a lot of integrated things and I wanted to create one 
00:34 that came from my Python For Entrepreneurs course 
00:37 that has many more integrations and is a much more well structured 
00:40 in my opinion than what you start with, 
00:43 so if we look here you can see I've got things 
00:46 like view models and template organizations and I'm using a lot of stuff there. 
00:51 I'm using Bower to manage the components rather than just point them off a CDNs, 
00:54 we have a database integrated, we have MailChimp, we have Rollbar,  
00:58 we have lots of cool stuff integrated, 
01:00 so I want to use this template as the example here 
01:02 so let's go in just run it to see what we get;
01:05 so I'll say cookiecutter and give it this, and I'm going to have 
01:09 some kind of required name here, this will be a show off the web app
01:13 just to show you what's going on actually, let's do it like this 
01:17 so we'll do it like this and of course we use a dependent property here 
01:21 to generate a valid Python package name which is necessary 
01:28 so we call this Talk Python the domain is talkpython.fm 
01:32 notice contact@talkpython.fm as a default 
01:35 so that's really nice, description goes at the top of the pages 
01:39 and then it ask you some questions about integration 
01:42 so like there's no real way to say pause, show them something
01:46 so it's just going to be blanks as I press enter, 
01:48 so I'll just put a few things you can see where this goes,  
01:50 it asks you what is your MailChimp API what's the key there 
01:53 so if you have the key you can put this in and automatically  
01:55 MailChimp will start working and this will be list 7, 
01:58 if you have an outbound email server you can set that up 
02:01 so this will be admin, and this is going to be root,
02:05 I'm just making up stuff right, the server is going to be local host 
02:11 port take the default for encrypted, and Rollbar I'll just put some random stuff there 
02:16 so now we have this template here, this thing is created by the template 
02:21 so what we can do to get started, the way Pyramid works 
02:26 is it works with package, it basically is a package 
02:28 and you have to register it, so for that reason I'm going to go ahead 
02:31 and create a virtual environment and set everything up here 
02:34 so give me a second and I'll zoom ahead in the presentation 
02:38 so I created the virtual environment, I activated it, now I just need to run the setup.py
02:43 to install everything, the dependencies as well as this package 
02:49 okay, so everything is set up and registered and installed just fine 
02:52 now we just need to run it, so we just run the server, say pserve
02:56 and give it the configuration file, 
02:59 perfect no problems here, sometimes it says 
03:02 the package that I just installed isn't found and I exit and log back in, 
03:05 so let's go over here, load this up and see what we got 
03:10 ok so this is what was generated by my package as the show off app up here, 
03:14 you can see down here it has a MailChimp support 
03:16 so I could put my email address and I could register 
03:19 now it turns out that's not going to work because I didn't give it a real key 
03:22 for MailChimp, but that's ok.
03:24 So we come to here we have a few things,
03:27 so notice this is the company name I put, this is the app name, 
03:33 if I was actually to open it up, you would see that this is the package name 
03:37 it's used throughout, let's look at one thing here, let's look at the development.any 
03:43 so you can go through this and see that it's been configured 
03:46 our smtp settings we gave it are configured 
03:49 this is configured, it looks like it might have a bug here 
03:51 about the list id versus API key, 
03:54 here's the Rollbar, everything that we need, right.
03:57 So this is great, this is a really good way to get started with this web app. 
04:01 Now my goal is to share this template with the world 
04:05 and get it listed on the cookiecutter homepage.
