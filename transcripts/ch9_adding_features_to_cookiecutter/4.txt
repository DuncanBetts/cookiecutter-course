00:01 Now that we have cookiecutter working here,
00:03 you're going to be tempted to want to just start adding your feature,
00:06 get in there and get into that source code, but let's take one step really quick 
00:09 so that things are a little simpler for us 
00:12 in order to add this feature on a feature branch 
00:15 so we can make multiple features, have them all in flight at the same time, things like that.
00:20 So I'm going to switch out of the terminal to my favorite git client which is SourceTree,
00:25 so I'm going to open this directory so I can get hold of it, 
00:28 go over here, let's come to source tree, and let's just put cookiecutter right there
00:32 ok that's my cookiecutter on GitHub, notice here you can see 
00:39 it's just got all the features from when was the last from what they did, here we go,
00:44 this is the last branch as you can see, 
00:48 these are all modified by me on my local version
00:51 this is the last branch in sync with cookiecutter itself.
00:55 When you do this, it'll probably be right at the top,
00:58 so you just want to branch from there, but I'm going to find the latest one
01:01 that's in sync with the official cookiecutter repo
01:05 and I'm going to create a branch because what I want to do is 
01:07 do all of the work only for that feature on that one branch, so let's do that. 
01:10 So we'll come over here, and we'll say branch, 
01:14 now here's a cool trick that you can use 
01:17 if you use your name or your user name or basically if you separate with slashes 
01:20 you can make a hierarchy of features, so I am going to say this 
01:23 I'll say mikeycennedy that's my github name 
01:26 and then I'm going to say forgiving YAML fix, 
01:30 so forgiving YAML formats not super annoying, 
01:34 hey you need a new line there, you forgot that version 
01:37 so I'm going to checkout to this particular commit,
01:41 and I'm going to go ahead and check out that new branch 
01:44 so I'll start working from there ok 
01:47 and notice, with the / here, this will actually create like a little tree of things,
01:50 which is pretty cool, so we're over here 
01:53 now notice, when we did that checkout it said 
01:56 hey there's this virtual environment here, I don't want that, so what I'm going to do is 
01:59 I'm going to say ignore everything under .env,
02:01 if this pull request gets accepted you probably won't have to do this, we'll see 
02:05 but we're going to just update the gitignore to say 
02:08 don't check in that virtual environment it's not cross-platform anyway 
02:12 so I'll just add that in real quick, ignore virtual env directory, ok,
02:17 so now everything is clean in our feature branch right here, 
02:22 if we go over here you can see that we have that one checked out 
02:26 we're on the forgiving YAML fix directory 
02:28 we're ready to make the code itself 
02:31 actually do the code change that makes this forgiving YAML.
