00:01 Next step is to actually run cookiecutter, so if I type which cookiecutter 
00:05 you'll see this is the one actually installed into Python 3.6
00:10 and installed into my machine at least my user profile 
00:14 now, couple of things to note here, one if you're on Windows,
00:17 you want to type where cookiecutter
00:20 on Linux and MacOS it's which, so those are basically 
00:24 equivalent commands but not exactly the same.
00:26 Second, cookiecutter runs both on Python 2 and on Python 3, 
00:29 but it's a little easier to develop under Python 2,
00:32 so we're going to create a Python 2 virtual environment, 
00:35 all right, so let's look here, we want to go into the cookiecutter folder 
00:39 and here we are in the cookiecutter folder, 
00:42 and we're going to create a virtual environment 
00:44 so we want to have, we want to say which virtualenv 
00:48 now you probably don't have this command, see I don't have it here for example,
00:52 so I want to install it but I want to make sure that it gets installed into Python 2,
00:55 so we'll say pip2 install virtualenv
00:59 to keep things simple I could even just do that to my user profile.
01:05 Now on windows, you can't say pip2, 
01:07 they for some reason don't have those aliases
01:10 so either create an alias or just make sure you run pip from Python 2.
01:14 Okay, so this should install it, great, it's already installed.
01:19 Next, after this we want to create the virtual environment, 
01:23 and again, to make sure that this is using Python 2
01:26 instead of Python 3, I want to be careful 
01:31 so I'm going to say instead of just saying virtual environment create the directory
01:35 I am going to say python2 -m virtualenv .env (-m for module)
01:38 So, whenÂ  we say .env, it's going to create one right at the root of the cookiecutter 
01:42 which we're going to ignore that, okay great, it's creating it here in this folder,
01:47 I want to make sure that I next actually activate this, 
01:51 so right now, if I ask which or where python2, it's the global one, 
01:55 so what I want to do is, I want to say (dot) on 
01:59 Windows you don't need to do the (dot) but on Mac and Linux you do,
02:03 so we'll say .env/bin/activate and it's activate.bat on windows,
02:08 notice how my prompt changed, now if I ask the same question, which python, 
02:12 you can see now it is this Python,
02:15 okay so we've installed the virtual environment, 
02:18 we've activated our virtual environment,
02:20 the final thing to do here is when we're in the folder with the setup
02:24 is to register it, so if I ask which cookiecutter, right now, it's still this one,
02:28 that's not cool, so that's the globally installed one, we're not modifying 
02:33 we want to have only run cookiecutter to run the code that's in this folder 
02:37 cool so what we're going to do, is we're going to say python 
02:40 and you might want to double check which Python,
02:44 that's the one in our virtual environment, okay cool,
02:47 python setup.py develop 
02:50 now the develop says don't copy this over to the system
02:54 but just leave it here, and point here when you run it 
02:57 like run it straight from our modifiable source here 
02:59 ok so go- beautiful, now let's ask the question again which cookiecutter
03:04 Perfect, so now we're going to run the one that is here, and if we actually try 
03:09 notice, if we actually try to change directories into there
03:15 ok perfect so now you can see that we have 
03:17 our cookiecutter installed and ready to go 
03:20 and let's just say cookiecutter -V for version 
03:23 oh notice this how it says it's not found, sometimes this happens 
03:27 and it's super annoying, I'm not quite sure why 
03:30 but I think if I exit my terminal, this is not always required, 
03:34 but I think in this case it might be 
03:37 I am going to exit the terminal, reactivate the environment,
03:39 and I think it should find cookiecutter again.
03:45 Reactivate the virtual environment, 
03:50 alright, so it looks good, there we go, yeah I don't know why,
03:57 you sometimes have to restart the shell but whatever, it doesn't matter
04:01 it's working fine, so you can see we have this, and it's from this location 
04:05 and it's running on Python 2.7, so at the end of this step 
04:08 you should have it, so it says cookiecutter whatever the version you got 
04:12 was from your virtual environment location 
04:14 or really where you checked out the code
04:17 and just say Python 2.7, 3.6, 3.5, something like that 
04:21 so now we can run cookiecutter locally, which is great,
04:25 now let's go add our feature.
