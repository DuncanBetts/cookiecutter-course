00:01 Now, our first step is going to be getting writable source code,
00:04 we could clone this repository but we're not allowed to check into it 
00:07 we're not core contributors, so the right flow here is to go fork it,
00:11 so we're going to fork this repository, and then we're going to create a feature branch 
00:16 do our work on the feature branch on our repository,
00:19 check that back in, and do a pull request back here, ok.
00:23 So I've already forked this, and so I'm going to come over to my fork here 
00:27 all right, so I've been fiddling around with it a little bit, 
00:31 you can see that it's this one I've submitted some changes,
00:34 this is an unrelated thing, but what we want to do is, we want to check this out.
00:38 So this one belongs to me, so I have right access to it cool.
00:42 So, let's go over, I think I'll just check this out here,
00:47 I don't want to put this into the source repository 
00:49 because you'll be able to link back to it on my system 
00:52 and you have the whole cookiecutter thing as a sub directory
00:56 which I don't think it's a great idea 
00:59 so I'm going to just clone that here
01:01 so we'll say git clone, and you give it the path,
01:04 of course you have git installed, but I'm assuming
01:07 that you guys can do that it's kind of out of the scope of this course
01:10 okay so here we can open a Cookiecutter project 
01:12 so now we have the source code on our machine 
01:15 next thing is to install it, so that we can actually run the code 
01:19 run the Cookiecutter module or package.
