00:03 Let's add a feature, really a bug fix in some sense,
00:06 an enhancement to cookiecutter.
00:09 There's a number of reasons why you might want to develop 
00:12 and change cookiecutter, maybe you want to take cookiecutter as it is 
00:16 and modify it to be your own custom version for some other project;
00:19 maybe you want to enhance it for everybody 
00:22 or maybe you just need to have a local working copy 
00:25 as part of your due diligence for your company, who knows.
00:28 But I'm going to assume in this case that we want to add 
00:31 a public feature back to cookiecutter.
00:34 So, as I have been going through this course and working on temples lately
00:37 I have been keeping a list of things that annoy me,
00:40 and when something annoys me I put it in the list somewhere and say 
00:43 this is a thing I could add to this project, so we're going to do that for cookiecutter, 
00:47 and let me introduce the thing that annoys me here.
00:50 So let's come over here and go to a working folder here
00:56 ok, so we're in this test folder let's try this cookiecutter and cookiecutter-template
01:05 see how it asks for my name, remember that name comes from the default yaml file
01:10 okay cool, so let's have a look at that default yaml file.
01:14 So, over here and remember I notice on line five here,
01:17 we have a blank new line, remember how annoying it was if that is not there 
01:21 let me try the same thing, all I did was it's hard to see, 
01:24 I deleted that blank line right there okay.
01:26 Let's run the same command again,
01:30 oh that yaml file again, unable to parse configuration 
01:36 no pattern matches github user name.
01:40 So that I think is super frustrating for beginners,
01:43 how would you know that you have to have that new line there 
01:47 this error is completely indecipherable,
01:50 so what I want to do is put this back just to show you if this were back here
01:55 run it again, it works; so that's cool, what I want to do is
01:59 I want to make it so it doesn't matter whether this new line is here or not 
02:03 in cookiecutter, I'm going to basically have cookiecutter add that new line if it's missing 
02:07 and because the parsing depends upon an external third party yaml parser,
02:12 and maybe we can go back and fix that as well, but for now,
02:15 let's just make cookiecutter forgiving okay.
02:18 So, in this chapter, what we're going to do is we're going to go
02:21 through the process of getting cookiecutter locally on my machine
02:24 being able to develop it, add this feature 
02:27 and going through the git flow pull request process to get it at least submitted 
02:31 back to the cookiecutter project, and we'll see if they accept it.
