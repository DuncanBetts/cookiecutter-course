00:01 Hello my Windows friends, let's get you all set up and ready 
00:04 to work on this class, and I have good news for you- 
00:06 until very recently, using Python on Windows has been 
00:09 actually fairly painful to get it set up and everything configured right, 
00:12 but with Python 3.5 the installer and the set up process
00:16 is way better, so let's get to it. 
00:18 To get started, you're going to need two resources on Windows, 
00:21 you're going to need to install Python 3 which you can get at python.org, 
00:25 and you're going to need to install PyCharm at jetbrains.com/pycharm
00:29 Let's go over to Windows 10, here is a brand new, 
00:33 completely fresh install of Windows 10 I just got from Microsoft, 
00:37 and I've open up the various web pages we're going to be working with;
00:40 first thing we have to do is install Python and as I told you, 
00:43 there is no Python on Windows, if I open this up 
00:46 and I type python there is no Python. 
00:49 So we have to download Python, and we want 3.5.1 
00:52 or whatever the latest version of 3 is and I've already actually downloaded it, 
00:56 so I won't click here, but you just click that, that's super easy,
00:59 the other thing we need to download is PyCharm, so here is PyCharm, 
01:02 it actually comes in two editions, the professional edition and the community edition, 
01:07 you can pick either for this class, the community edition is totally fine, 
01:10 the things you'll be missing are you'll basically be missing out 
01:14 on web development and database management features from the professional edition, 
01:18 and the community for straight pure Python has the same features as professional. 
01:23 If for some reason you don't want to use PyCharm, 
01:25 you want something more lightweight, 
01:28 you can use Atom, at atom.io, atom is from GitHub, it's pretty cool, 
01:30 I really like this editor, you can see there is a little video here,
01:33 I recommend you watch it, it's pretty hilarious, 
01:36 Sublime Text is also a super popular lightweight editor 
01:39 and I told you about Visual Studio so you can get Visual Studio community edition, 
01:44 this is now a free full-fledged version of Visual Studio, 
01:47 and you can get Python tools for Visual Studio, 
01:50 plug this together and you're doing pretty good. 
01:53 But, we're going to be using PyCharm in the class, 
01:55 so that is what I will set up here. Let's start by installing Python. 
01:58 So I've got it downloaded, and I'm going to run it, 
02:03 now it has a couple of options in the installer, 
02:06 let's say if you're going to try to just type python 
02:09 from the command line or other tools like pip, for installing packages, 
02:13 you probably want to add this to your path and let's customize installation
02:17 just to see what we get, we get documentation pip which manages packages, 
02:20 we'll talk about that in our apps, and we have the test suite
02:23 and py launcher is really nice, and we don't need to install it for all the users. 
02:28 Let's go ahead and pre compile the standard library, 
02:31 that will give us a little better perf, I really don't like this big long folder here, 
02:34 so this app data folder is hidden in Windows, 
02:38 so it's kind of hard to discover where these are 
02:40 so I am just going to put a Python folder directly in my user profile 
02:43 and then in case you want to have a 64 bit or 32 bit version of Python 
02:48 or maybe different types 2.7, 3.5 you probably want to leave this specifier here, 
02:52 that seems like a good setup, let's go. 
02:55 
03:00 Alright, Python was set up successfully, let's close this 
03:03 and let's just find out, if I type python --version 
03:06 we should see 3.5.1 and survey says, success, okay, Python is working. 
03:10 Last thing to set up is just PyCharm. 
03:13 So the installer is just a standard Windows installer,
03:18 just sort of yes your way through, it's up to you 
03:22 whether you associate py files with it, I typically don't do that but it's your call. 
03:26 Okay, so it looks like we successfully installed PyCharm, 
03:30 that was easy, let's go and run it, brand new, nothing to import, 
03:34 now, normally I would log in with my JetBrains account, 
03:37 but for this purpose I'll just evaluate it, say okay, that's great, 
03:40 the first time you launch PyCharm it asks you what theme 
03:44 and keyword scheme you want to use, because this is Windows, 
03:47 I'll say Visual Studio keyboard theme and I like my code dark, 
03:50 the editor is dark and the code, text to be light, 
03:54 so I am going to pick the Dracula theme, you pick whichever you like.
03:57 And there you have it, PyCharm is up and ready to roll. 
04:02 This brand new version of Windows 10 is ready, 
04:05 so without further ado, let's move on.
