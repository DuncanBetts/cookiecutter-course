00:01 Any time you have a bounded list of options and that list is pretty short, 
00:04 it's really nice to make that what is called a choice variable. 
00:08 So here we come in in Pyramid, the Cookiecutter starter example
00:12 this is one of the main official cookiecutters 
00:16 for creating a basic more or less empty Pyramid web application, 
00:20 they come in here, one of the questions they have to ask you is 
00:23 do you want to use Jinja2 or do you want to use Chameleon 
00:26 as your underlying templating engine. 
00:28 So if we come in it will ask us things like what is the project name, and so on, 
00:31 and then it says select your templating language 1 for Jinja2, 2 for Chameleon. 
00:34 And notice that whichever you want the default to be, 
00:38 that one should be listed first in this list. 
00:41 So this works great when your options are a small set of known items, 
00:46 here we just have two and the chances somebody misspells Chameleon 
00:50 or doesn't know they can type Chameleon or Jinja 
00:53 1 or 2, anybody can do that, this works really well. 
00:56 So in the cookiecutter.json, that is how we control these, 
01:00 and we saw this is really just a list of strings, so here we have a list of strings, 
01:03 and they get turned into number 1, number 2, number 3 for user input.
