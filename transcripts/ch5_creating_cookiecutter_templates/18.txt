00:01 Now you know how to create these Cookiecutter templates 
00:03 and I feel like I've shown you something of the hard way. 
00:06 And I did that on purpose, not to torture you 
00:09 but because I want you to really see and understand all the moving parts, 
00:12 but, if I was going to go create a new Cookiecutter template, 
00:15 there is a very good chance I would use a Cookiecutter template to do that. 
00:19 That's kind of circular, isn't it, but there is a template called cookiecutter-template, 
00:24 and its goal is to ask you the questions to generate 
00:28 the basic project structure for creating a Cookiecutter template. 
00:32 So you can get it from this URL here, let's go and run it. 
00:35 Alright, my name is Michael Kennedy, remember that comes from my default file, 
00:39 similarly my email, my GitHub user name all these things, 
00:42 the name of the project, let's suppose we want to do something 
00:45 with race cars simulations, so I'll call this Race Sim, 
00:49 something like that, and notice, it uses that dependent thing 
00:56 to generate the right naming structure, it's going to put cookiecutter-
01:01 which is the convention for naming these templates,
01:05 it's not required but it's the convention, and it slugifies, if you will,
01:08 it creates the lower case no spaces version of the name,
01:13 so perfect, let's just go with that, short description, 
01:16 this will be the starter template for creating race car simulations. 
01:22 Okay, again, today is the day we are going to do it; 
01:29 yes, we want to copy hooks.
01:33 Boom it's done, okay, let's see what we got, it should be in cookiecutter-race-sim 
01:37 and there it is so let's open it up, alright, now in here,
01:41 notice, we've got a Cookiecutter template, it has a cookiecutter.json 
01:47 and it has a directory that has got a name in there and it's going to have 
01:51 basically the project slug name put there when you run it, it also has a CHANGELOG, 
01:55 it has hooks, a post generation hook with some code already built for us, 
02:01 so we can use that to start, no pre gen hook but that's okay, 
02:05 it has a license, a README and so on. 
02:08 This is really nice and if you're going to get started, 
02:11 just make sure, you don't want to make any mistakes, 
02:13 so might as well just say cookiecutter cookiecutter-template 
02:15 And get started that way.
