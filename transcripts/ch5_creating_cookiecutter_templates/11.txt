00:01 Jinja 2 comes with the ability to write extensions for its template language, 
00:04 here is the officially listed extensions as well as the API 
00:08 that we can go to and write our own. 
00:10 We could also go to github and do searches for those extensions, 
00:13 and we saw that there were 25 of those, at the time of the recording, 
00:17 that is pretty cool, so if we want to use the extension, 
00:20 we have to list it, right here in this _extensions. 
00:24 Now, unfortunately, this must be an installed Python package, 
00:28 which means pip install package name typically depending on, 
00:33 there is a few intricacies around which version of pip you're using 
00:38 based on your path and so on, so this can get actually a little bit tricky 
00:41 for your users and it's too bad that it doesn't somehow install 
00:45 this kind of automatically, as part of the template creation, 
00:49 so maybe there is some work to do, on this project to say look, 
00:52 it requires these extensions if you either run this, 
00:55 this command or I can do it for you, as part of the execution, 
00:59 and we'll set this up in your user profile, so from now on 
01:02 you can use these extensions there is a little bit of a security tightrope
01:06 to walk there but I think something like that would be really nice, 
01:09 it doesn't exist now so if you're going to do this, 
01:11 your users have to install Jinja 2 time before they could run this template. 
01:15 But once we put this in here as an extension, then in our project, 
01:18 we can say things like release date is {% now}. 
01:24 And that comes from the time extension, so that's really cool.
