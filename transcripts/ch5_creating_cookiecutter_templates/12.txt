00:01 Let's imagine you want to create a template 
00:04 that will generate projects and those projects themselves 
00:07 need to be able to run a Cookiecutter template. 
00:11 Well that can pose a real problem 
00:13 because anything in this entire directory structure is going to be 
00:16 renamed and modified and so on, but as you know, 
00:19 we probably want our Cookiecutter to have {{cookiecutter.project_name}} 
00:24 for its directory and it's going to have its own cookiecutter.json 
00:27 and its own replacements in its files, and so on, 
00:30 so if you want to ship Jinja content that you want to be not modified, 
00:34 as part of this template generation process, you can do it and it's pretty easy. 
00:40 So if your project especially ships with a Cookiecutter template 
00:44 that is supposed to arrive in Cookiecutter template form, not process, 
00:48 you're going to need to take this step. 
00:51 So we can come over here to our projects, and you've seen the prompt bits, 
00:54 but the new things is we can now add copy without render, 
00:58 and we can apply this to a couple of things, 
01:00 we can say anything under the static folder, 
01:02 these are like big files and so on, just leave them alone,
01:05 there is maybe hundreds of files, 
01:08 maybe our project will generate its template quicker 
01:11 if we just say stay out of static, there is nothing in here for you to do, 
01:14 we can also say don't mess with cookiecutter.json now to be clear, 
01:17 this is not this file, this is the file inside the project, a little bit further down. 
01:22 This is the file within your template and finally, 
01:24 you can also say if there is a directory called {{cookiecutter.project_slug}}
01:30 well, leave that alone as well 
01:33 because that is the top level to your template maybe.
