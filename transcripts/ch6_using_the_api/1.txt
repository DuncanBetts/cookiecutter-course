00:01 Cookiecutter is a very powerful in its own right.
00:04 We've seen the pre and post generation hooks,
00:06 the dependent properties in the cookiecutter.json, and so on,
00:09 so there is quite a bit we can do just within Cookiecutter itself,
00:12 but, there are many times we want more control over this,
00:15 or we wanted to feel more native or we don't want to tell people
00:19 hey you have to use Cookiecutter, just say use our application,
00:22 run this command and you'll get started,
00:24 but we of course don't want to do all that file management, projects,
00:27 text juggling that Cookicutter does for us. 
00:30 So, we can wrap the Cookicutter API in our own application,
00:34 be that Python, .Net, Java whatever, and we can use that 
00:39 to interact with the user, but actually use the Cookicutter API 
00:43 just like you've seen all the features we've seen creating the templates, 
00:47 we can use that from the API to create our project in the end. 
00:51 So, I'll give you two quick examples,
00:53 if I want to get a new project started in Pyramid, the web framework in Python, 
00:57 there is a whole bunch of stuff 
00:59 I've got to do really to get started, I've got to create the templates, 
01:02 I've got to create the views and maybe even I want testing, 
01:05 it's a Python package, so it's got to have a certain amount or structure put together 
01:08 so that it represents that, there is a lot of things to do to get started. 
01:12 And sort of just telling you to do that, they say 
01:16 hey you can just run this command pcreate -s (for scaffold) starter 
01:20 and the name of your app, and we'll go and create that for you, 
01:23 so then you can just run it and have a working app to start from,
01:27 that's great; it turns out pcreate actually wraps the cookicutter API 
01:31 and calls the started Cookicutter template from Pyramid 
01:35 to do that, which is really cool. 
01:37 You run this command, it asks you a few questions, 
01:39 probably looks familiar, it doesn't have to though, because, 
01:42 you can ask these questions in your app 
01:45 and just feed the answers directly to Cookiecutter. 
01:48 Another example might be django-admin, 
01:50 maybe we want to create a new project called my site, 
01:53 something like this, I don't think django-admin uses cookicutter, 
01:55 it may, but it's just another example of here is some part of my app, 
02:00 it helps you get started by generating a project 
02:02 that could easily be a Cookicutter template. 
02:05 Right, off it goes, it does whatever it does to create your project, 
02:07 ideally that's with Cookicutter.
