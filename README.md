## Course Summary

Getting started with new projects in a reliable, easy, and reproducible way is very important. Cookiecutter has become one of the most popular tools to accomplish this. In this course you will learn how consume the over 1,000 existing project templates for a wide variety of languages as well as create your own templates for your public or internal projects.

## What's this course about and how is it different?

This course has three goals:

1. Teach to you *fully understand* and leverage Cookiecutter to create and manage your projects.
2. Provide the tools and techniques needed to *create your own templates*. This is especially important if you run a software project and need to bring on new developers (public or inside the corporate firewall).
3. Show you how to *contribute back to Cookiecutter*. Once you begin leveraging Cookiecutter for your projects, you'll soon want to add *that one missing feature*. We'll cover everything you need in this course.

## Who is this course for?

This course is widely applicable to developers, data scientists, and many more people. Anyone who wants to take advantage of the many existing templates or create their own templates.

For the majority of this course, you **will not** need to know Python. Cookiecutter is built with Python but we'll teach you everything you need to setup your system with Python and run the code.

Only those who want to create advanced templates with pre- and post-generation hooks or contribute back to Cookiecutter itself need to be fluent in Python.
